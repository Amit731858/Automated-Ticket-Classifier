# TICKET CLASSIFIER

This project aims to develop a model which takes tickets raised by customers in a banking platform as input and classify them into different classes for better routing experience.
## Objectives:

   - **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized Python libraries â€” NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and SpaCy for data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- **EDA**: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using the visualization library Matplotlib.  
- **Data Labelling**: Labeled each datapoint using the concept of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization.  
- **Model Building & Fine-Tuning**: Employed models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with GridSearchCV for classification, achieving **97% accuracy** on Logistic Regression.  


## Tech Stack/Frameworks:

    Frontend: HTML, CSS
    Backend: Flask
    Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, SpaCy
